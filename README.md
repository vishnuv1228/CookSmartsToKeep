# CookSmartsToKeep

You can email recipes and ingredients to yourself with CookSmarts, but I wanted to create a list version of this in Google Keep. When I'm walking around Trader Joe's, a list on my phone could be pretty handy. 

To Run

Once you email the recipes and ingredients for the week to yourself, simply download the file to the project directory. Make sure to install BeautifulSoup and gkeepapi: https://github.com/kiwiz/gkeepapi. Replace the credentials with your gmail username and password in the keep.login() line. Replace filenames, titles, and colors as you please. Thanks!
